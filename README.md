How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I focus on breaking programs into clear, reusable function that can each handle a specfic task. For the CRUD Python module having modular code made implementing the dashboard widgets to the database. This method simplifies the debugging process and streamlines future updates because the code is organized and easy to follow. Thie CRUD module can be used for any project that needs basic database operations, after changing the constructor to fit my needs.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 

  I took everything that Grazioso Salvare wanted, and broke it down into acheivable milestones. Starting with a basic CRUD function, and ending with a Fully functional dashboard that uses geolocations. This required real world usability, and thinking of ways that a user might want to use this specific program. In the future I would i would verify any additional input that the client might need, or create a GUI to include for them to create additional searching terms for.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

  Computer Scientists solve prolems by designing efficient, scalable, and reliable software and applications. This matters to companies like Grazioso Salvare because the dashboard we made can literally make sure they are sending the right animal out for a rescue operation. This project directly supports our goal by improving how readily available that information is, and where an animal might be, and in the short term help them save lives by using our quick and efficient dashboard.
